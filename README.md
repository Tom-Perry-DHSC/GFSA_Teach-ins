# GFSA_Teach-ins
Materials for GORS Fast Stream Analyst programming teach-in sessions.

## R

We have created the first course in the GFSA Programming side of GFSA L&D, based on using R. It was the most requested language and is used widely by GFSAs.

The first series is called "An Intro to R" and will have four sessions.

- The first is based on an introduction to R the language and will touch on using R Studio. This is likely to be the longest session in the series but you will have chance to go over this in your own time.
- The second session looks at importing/exporting data as well as forming the datasets you want. This includes the join features (joining two tables to make them wider) and bind functions (joining two tables to make them longer).
- The third considers data manipulation using the tidyverse. This are incredibly powerful functions that will allow you to produce high-quality analysis from very few functions.
- The fourth and session rounds off the series with data visualisation. We focus on the ggplot2 package, which is part of the tidyverse and is incredibly easy to learn as a beginner.
